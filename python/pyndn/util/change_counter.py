"""
This module defines the ChangeCounter class which keeps a target object whose
change count is tracked by a local change count.  You can set to a new target
which updates the local change count, and you can call checkChanged
to check if the target (or one of the target's targets) has been changed.
The target object must have a method getChangeCount.
